 * This comment section explains the basic idea behind the implementation.
 *
 * Vectors difference notation
 * ===========================
 * Let v and w be vectors. For readability purposes, unless explicitly
 * otherwise noted, the notation vw will be used to represent w - v.
 *
 * Relationship between a vector and a triangle in 3d space
 * ========================================================
 * Vector in the area of a triangle
 * --------------------------------
 * Let T = (a, b, c) be a triangle, where a, b and c are also vectors and
 * linearly independent. A vector inside that triangle can be written as one of
 * its vertices plus the sum of the positively scaled vectors from that vertex
 * to the other ones. Taking a as the first vertex, a vector p in the area
 * formed by T can be written as:
 *
 *     p = a + w_ab * ab + w_ac * ac
 *
 * It's fairly easy to see that if p is in the area formed by T, then w_ab >= 0
 * and w_ac >= 0. That vector p can also be written as:
 *
 *     p = b + w_ba * ba + w_bc * bc
 *
 * It's easy to check that the triangle formed by (a + w_ab * ab, b + w_ba *
 * ba, p) is similar to T and, with the correct algebraic manipulations, we can
 * come to the conclusion that:
 *
 *     w_ba = 1 - w_ab - w_ac
 *
 * Since we know that w_ba >= 0, then w_ab + w_ac <= 1. Thus:
 *
 *     ----------------------------------------------------------
 *     | p = a + w_ab * ab + w_ac * ac is in the area of T iff: |
 *     | w_ab >= 0 and w_ac >= 0 and w_ab + w_ac <= 1           |
 *     ----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Proving backwards shouldn't be difficult.
 *
 * Vector p can also be written as:
 *
 *     p = (1 - w_ab - w_ba) * a + w_ab * b + w_ba * c
 *
 *
 * Vector that crosses a triangle
 * ------------------------------
 * Let T be the same triangle discussed above and let v be a vector such that:
 *
 *     v = x * a + y * b + z * c
 *     where x >= 0, y >= 0, z >= 0, and x + y + z > 0.
 *
 * It's geometrically easy to see that v crosses the triangle T. But that can
 * also be verified analytically.
 *
 * The vector v crosses the triangle T iff there's a positive alpha such that
 * alpha * v is in the area formed by T, so we need to prove that such value
 * exists. To find alpha, we solve the equation alpha * v = p, which will lead
 * us to the system, for the variables alpha, w_ab and w_ac:
 *
 *    alpha * x = 1 - w_ab - w_ac
 *    alpha * y = w_ab
 *    alpha * z = w_ac,
 *    where w_ab >= 0 and w_ac >= 0 and w_ab + w_ac <= 1
 *
 * That will lead to alpha = 1 / (x + y + z), w_ab = y / (x + y + b) and
 * w_ac = z / (x + y + z) and the following holds:
 *  - alpha does exist because x + y + z > 0.
 *  - w_ab >= 0 and w_ac >= 0 because y >= 0 and z >= 0 and x + y + z > 0.
 *  - 0 <= 1 - w_ab - w_ac <= 1 because 0 <= (y + z) / (x + y + z) <= 1.
 *
 * Thus:
 *
 *     ----------------------------------------------------------
 *     | v = x * a + y * b + z * c crosses T = (a, b, c), where |
 *     | a, b and c are linearly independent, iff:              |
 *     | x >= 0, y >= 0, z >= 0 and x + y + z > 0               |
 *     ----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Moreover:
 *  - if one of the coefficients is zero, then v crosses the edge formed by the
 *  vertices multiplied by the non-zero coefficients.
 *  - if two of the coefficients are zero, then v crosses the vertex multiplied
 *  by the non-zero coefficient.
